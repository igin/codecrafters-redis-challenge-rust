This is my attempt at solving the codecrafters.io redis challenge in rust.
At this point rust is a very new language for me so I am definetly making
a lot of silly mistakes. Also this version of redis is a very basic variant
without persistance or threadsafety. 

Anyway I still learned a lot about rust and how redis is supposed to work.
Have a look around and please leave some comments if you find things I 
could improve. Thank you!
